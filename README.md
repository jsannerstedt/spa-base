#spa-base

A really simple approach for a Single Page Application. Based on requirejs and knockoutjs, the idea is to be able to create several modules or pages, without needing any routing or configuration.

To create a new page, simply put a template viewmodel pair in the modules folder. To load it onto the page, simply navigate to index.html#[modulename].

## getting started
just run bower install, and load index.html
